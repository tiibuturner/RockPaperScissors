# RockPaperScissors
 One of our assignments in Ohjelmistotestaus (Software Testing). Assignment was to make a classic game of rock-paper-scissors and your opponent (computer) plays random. There is also an deliberation about the subject (enough tests, what to consider in a testing). Deliberation is (unfortunately) only in Finnish.
